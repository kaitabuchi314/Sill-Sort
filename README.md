# Silly-Sort
Silly Sort - A sorting algorithm almost as fast as Quicksort!

But how does silly sort work?
Make a variable called end.
After that, we calculate the sill, the sill is the largest in an array excluding the last one.
We move the sill to the end, increase end by one every time sill moves to the end
Preform bubble sort on the last items in the array, what items, well, we use "end" variable items.
Repeat process until array is sorted.
